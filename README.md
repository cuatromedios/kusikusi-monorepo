Kusikusi is both a CMS and a collection of packages for Laravel and Lumen for the creation of applications based on hierarchical data, like the data found on most websites. We are not reinventing the wheel, Kusikusi is built on top of Lumen and Laravel frameworks, so it uses all well proven packages like Eloquent ORM and can be deployed on almost any hosting provider using PHP and MySQL. KusiKusi has its own way to organize models and its relations, mainly tree based relations.

Kusikusi or its packages can be used as:
* A full CMS
* Headless CMS
* An API first application
* Backend for web applications
* Backend of mobile applications

## Installation

> Please note Kusikusi is based in [Laravel Framework](https://www.laravel.com/), so it is reccomended if you have previous experience working with it.

Kusikusi can be installed as CMS for brand new Laravel or Lumen application, or you can use its packages in a existing one.

#### Lumen based Kusikusi CMS

This is the recommended starting point for creating most websites, because Lumen is a lightweight micro-framework

#### Laravel based Kusikusi CMS

This is the starting point for creating new websites that require Laravel features not included in Lumen, like sessions for registered users.

#### Kusikusi packages

The individual packages or components can also be used in existing Laravel or Lumen applications:

* Models
* Website Controller
* API Controller
* Admin Interfaces
